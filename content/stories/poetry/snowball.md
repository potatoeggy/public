White falls from the sky \
onto a mountain \
and so a snowball grows.

<!-- more -->

White falls from the sky \
on the village beside \
but the snow is shoveled aside. \
People laugh and they play, \
pushing problems away \
as the snowball grows.

The white comes down heavier \
and the villagers cheer \
but the mayor sees the danger. \
He travels around \
telling the town \
as the snowball grows.

"It's just a snowball," one person says \
as they stare at their screen. \
"We'll take care of it later," another suggests, \
the paperwork beside them untouched. \
"It's not going to hit us," asserts a third \
as they walk into their door. \
"That's a fake snowball," somebody claims \
as they wear their red cap. \
"That's too much work," the last person scoffs \
in his house barren of items.

And so the snowball grows.

One day the sun rises \
but the snowball \
blocks its light \
and its shadow \
looms over \
the village.

Panic erupts — \
the villagers scramble \
up to the mountain \
to hack away at the snowball.

The white comes down faster — \
the villagers pray \
but the snowball \
continues to grow.

Finally — \
the snowball is freed.

One house is crushed. \
A sigh of relief, \
and everyone return \
to help rebuild the house.

The next year: \
white falls from the sky \
onto a mountain \
and so a snowball grows.
