<br />

**kai!:** wassup y'all!!

**kai!:** welcome to the nerry fan club

**kai!:** y'all better be nerry fans too or else i will hunt you down >:(

<!-- more -->

<br />

**Sara Al-Dosari** *changed their name to* **sara**

<br />

**sara:** omg the narwhal's name is nerry?? wait i never knew that's so cute

**Zahir Kirmani:** it's just marketing. they're trying to manipulate us

**kai!:** zahir change your name to something fun

**Zahir Kirmani:** no

**sara:** can you stop imagining everyone is trying to manipulate you for ONE SECOND and just appreciate nerry

**Zahir Kirmani:** everyone wants something in the real world

**Zahir Kirmani:** even the people who drew nerry

<br />**kai!** *changed* **Zahir Kirmani***'s name to* **i must be fun at parties**

**i must be fun at parties** *changed their name to* **zahir**

<br />

**zahir:** no

**sara:** how many sticks can one man fit up his ass

---

*April Evans, Valerie Torres*

**Valerie:** hello :)

**April:** Hi! It's April!! My tab: 1x beverage at Monoceros

**April:** I'm gonna have to trust you to hold me to it

**Valerie:** will do o7

---

*nerry the narwhal fan club! (kai!, sara, zahir)*

**sara:** how is it possible that one man can possibly so stupid

**zahir:** what now

**zahir:** spit it out ik you're talking about me

**sara:** funny how you think i'm referring to you

**sara:** i wonder what that means

**zahir:** that i can tell how someone added to the group chat in the last two days and who i've barely spoken to thinks

**sara:** oh please

**sara:** how can someone wearing a dingy suit everywhere not have at least a couple loose screws. you have the ethical mindset of elon musk

**zahir:** i don't see how you can possibly justify that 

**kai!:** shockingly, zahir actually has principles

**kai!:** if you make him sign a contract in writing that stops him from taking cookies out of the cookie jar after midnight

**kai!:** he will actually stop taking cookies out from the cookie jar after midnight

**zahir:** exactly. my word is priceless

**kai!:** i wouldn't go THAT far

**kai!:** the fee for breach of contract is clearly stated on the contract as a hundred dollars

**zahir:** same difference

**sara:** true tbh

<br />

*Kai Nakayama, Zahir Kimani*

**Zahir:** my suit isn't dingy is it?

**Kai:** nope

**Kai:** it's dark gray and striped and perfect. nothing but perfection

**Zahir:** somehow i sense sarcasm coming from you

---

*April Evans, Valerie Torres*

**April:** Hi Vallie!!! I'll buy you a drink if you're by Monoceros and can be my rubber duck because my mind is BOUNCING with ideas 

**Valerie:** deal!! i'll be there in 3

---

*nerry the narwhal fan club (kai!, sara, zahir)*

**sara:** kai pancakes or waffles

**kai!:** depends! in what context

**zahir:** ...why tf does it change depending on the context

**sara:** for consumption

**kai!:** still depends! if like

**kai!:** you have a lot of syrup

**kai!:** pancakes get soggy super quickly

**kai!:** but they're fluffier right out of the gate right

**kai!:** so if you eat them fresh and light on toppings

**kai!:** they are heaven

**kai!:** but waffles last longer

**sara:** excuse me i did not come for a NUANCED answer one of us has to be right

**sara:** i asked some other people in the cafe and we keep tying up

**sara:** oop i think they're going pretty hard at it rn

**zahir:** i'm adding them here

**sara:** how rude of you to interrupt them and ask for their numbers

**sara:** for someone who talks to so many recruiters you are remarkably shit at talking to normal people

**kai!:** wait do i know them?

**zahir:** no idea. doesn't matter. this is more important

<br />

**zahir** *added* **April Evans, Valerie Torres** *to the group.*

<br />

**kai!:** hello new people!

**kai!:** ik y'all are having your pancake v waffle discussion but before you go back to reaming each other

**kai!:** are you nerry the narwhal fans?

<br />

**April Evans** *changed their name to* **April**

**Valerie Torres** *changed their name to* **valerie**

<br />

**April:** The mascot? Huge fan

**April:** The biggest fan

**April:** My entire novel is based around the narwhal

**April:** Its name is Nerry?

**kai!:** ya!

**kai!:** that's what the barista said when i asked him

**valerie:** i would die for him <3

**sara:** wait april you're writing a novel?? about narwhals?

**April:** Yep üôÇ

**sara:** that is so cool

**zahir:** ahem. we're getting off-topic.

**kai!:** uh oh

**kai!:** zahir is grumpy!

**kai!:** he's bringing out the ending punctuation!!

**kai!:** sara beware

**sara:** oh i am here for it

**zahir:** shut up

**zahir:** as i was saying

**zahir:** we must come to a conclusion.

**zahir:** i have a proposal

**zahir:** kai if you want free food you should come to monoceros

**kai!:** free???? food????? from zahir?????? give me two mins

---

*nerry the narwhal fan club! (kai!, zahir, sara, April, valerie)*

**April:** Did you know "Monoceros" is a constellation of a unicorn?

**sara:** it's also the genus name for the narwhal!!

**sara:** which since we're all nerry fans here i expect none of you to betray nerry ever and make him sad

**April:** Is Nerry a girl? I always headcanoned her as a she

**valerie:** me too!

**sara:** no way

**sara:** nerry is clearly a guy's name

**sara:** like perry the platypus

**sara:** so nerry the narwhal

**kai!:** headcanon?

**zahir:** it means a belief that isn't part of the canon of the original work in a fandom

**kai!:** how do YOU know this

**sara:** yeah wait how does ZAHIR know this

**zahir:** no comment.

---

*nerry the narwhal fan club! (kai!, zahir, sara, April, valerie)*

**April:** In your opinions, why would someone suddenly become adventurous and risk everything they've built up over the last four years?

**sara:** love

**zahir:** stupidity

**kai!:** the duality of man

**sara:** the two are not mutually exclusive

**zahir:** the two are not mutually exclusive

**zahir:** i hate it when you do that

**sara:** you're telling me

**valerie:** change! something happens to the character and then the character has to change in return

**valerie:** this can include love or stupidity

**valerie:** (the two are not mutually exclusive)

---

*nerry the narwhal fan club! (kai!, sara, zahir, April, valerie)*

**kai!:** burning the midnight oil!

\[Attachment: \*2024-11-20_02_11.PNG\*\]

**April:** Yeah! I would join you guys since I've got an English assignment that's due in six hours but I *really* am not good at focusing in groups

**April:** You guys might have noticed today since I forgot my yap sign

**kai!:** maybe a teensy weensy bit

**kai!:** but it's okay!!

**sara:** what yap sign üëÄ

**valerie:** omg it's the cutest thing ever i swear

**valerie:** it's like a little "do not disturb i am a yapper" sign

**April:** Vallie!! My number one favourite rubber ducky ü¶Ü

**valerie:** hi april!!!

**sara:** i need to see that holy crap that sounds ADORABLE

**sara:** april next time you're working ping me

**April:** Will do ü´°

*Kai Nakayama, Zahir Kirmani*

**zahir:** when are you coming back

**zahir:** i have to sleep. you know this.

**zahir:** i have an interview tomorrow morning.

**kai:** crap

**kai:** i am so sorry i forgot

**kai:** i will come back immediately

**zahir:** adding one to the tab

**kai:** cash it in whenever!

**kai:** but maybe not this week bc magnolia messaged me AGAIN about updating her commission

**zahir:** you should stop them from bossing you around so much

**kai:** no can do

**kai:** the customer is always right

**zahir:** if the customer is always right then the business owner is never wrong

**zahir:** fuck em

*nerry the narwhal fan club! (kai!, zahir, sara, April, valerie)*

**kai!:** i'm dying in statics rn

**kai!:** why are forces so complicated

**kai!:** they're not even real

**kai!:** my buildings aren't gonna suddenly collapse that's crazy

**April:** Oh no üôÅ

**April:** I'm not a STEM student so I can't help you sorry

**sara:** i'm a stem kid but i major in the wrong kind of stem :p

**sara:** but i sorta feel you

**sara:** we have london forces in chem and those are real sons of bitches

**zahir:** sucks to be you

**sara:** ok zahir you're in business

**sara:** your whole program is basically self-study and pretentious mba wannabes jerking themselves off while pretending they're learning useful skills

**sara:** you probably aren't studying anything even remotely relevant

**zahir:** damn right i'm not

**zahir:** i'm here for my job and my degree and i'm dipping

<br />

Valerie looked over to see Zahir *tap-tap*ing away in the group chat.

<br />

**kai!:** fuck you too zahir

**kai!:** anyone wanna grab drinks tonight

**sara:** what happened to brunch mimosas :(

**kai!:** we should do that too!!

**kai!:** but i need a drink after this professor yaps my ear off and my usual gang is too busy recovering from him

**sara:** i'd never say no to more alcohol ;)

**zahir:** i need a drink too

**zahir:** there is too much bullshit in this world

**April:** Count me in! I get a little more creative under alcohol and I could use some of that creativity juice

**April:** Some of my best ideas come while I'm drunk

**April:** Vallie!! I will buy you a drink if you take notes for me

**valerie:** sign me up!!

*Valerie Torres, Zahir Kirmani*

**Valerie:** hey zahir! do you happen to know an aster remington in my year? he's also in business and he says that he knows you

**Zahir:** why.

**Valerie:** i wanted to check if you did know him

**Zahir:** i do. are you friends with him?

**Valerie:** not really, we just met, he seems nice

**Zahir:** i see. i suggest not being friends with him then

**Valerie:** why?

**Zahir:** he's a plagiarist. hasn't been caught yet

**Zahir:** and he doesn't know me. i know him.

**Valerie:** huh

**Valerie:** i...see

**Valerie:** i think

**Zahir:** that's all you need to know.

*Sara Al-Dosari, Zahir Kirmani*

**Sara:** i understand what it's like to be you now

**Zahir:** oh?

---

*nerry the narwhal fan club! (kai!, zahir, sara, April, valerie)*

**kai!:** hey y'all!!

**kai!:** happy thursday hope everyone is stayin alive

**kai!:** what clubs are you guys in?

**kai!:** and do you think you could drag me and zahir around bc this man was so traumatised by the business clubs he didn't join any other club

**sara:** that explains so much

**sara:** i'm in the medsci club! so probably not super helpful but i'd be down to help

**sara:** sometimes i go to socratica (where you work on a project and show it off)

**sara:** i also used to do archery but those days are long past

**sara:** i still keep in touch with a few members so i could point you there too

**April:** I'm in creative writing (no surprises there)

**April:** We have weeklies every Thursday at 9 pm

**April:** I'm also in the cheese club? If you're interested in that

**valerie:** i'm in the tea club!! people just come in and out so it's super chill for new members to join whenever

**valerie:** but kai i think you're also in there?

**valerie:** i'm also in the board games club, poker club, and robotics club

**kai!:** heh yeah vallie i still owe you admission for the last two weeks

**kai!:** thanks guys!!

**kai!:** i'll pass these on

**zahir:** i'm also in this group chat

**kai!:** oh yeah

**kai!:** you can look at them yourself then :D

<br />

*Zahir Kirmani, Sara Al-Dosari*

**Zahir:** what's socratica

**Sara:** very simple

**Sara:** you pick something you want to work on

**Sara:** it can be anything

**Sara:** then at the end of the 3 h work session everyone shows off what they made

**Sara:** (everyone else there is also picking something to work on)

**Sara:** ngl i can see you fitting in there

**Zahir:** i agree

**Zahir:** there is potential.

**Sara:** ...if you want me to go with you you can just say so

**Zahir:** don't bother

**Zahir:** send me the information and i'll find my own time

---

*nerry the narwhal fan club! (kai!, sara, zahir, April, valerie)*

**April:** Guys I'm afraid Zahir is going to commit a felony

**April:** He's assured me that everything he's doing is completely above board but for some reason I have my doubts

**kai!:** if he told you it's legal it's probably legal!

**kai!:** but what is it üëÄ

**kai!:** he never tells me all of his fun plans until the damage is already done

**April:** Originally it was identity theft? But apparently that wasn't bad enough so now I'm a little scared that he's going to ruin some guy's life

**kai!:** oh shit

**kai!:** worse than identity theft??

**sara:** pretty sure that's a crime

**kai!:** tbh it's more unusual that he plans something stupid without involving any crimes

**April:** Yeah so he's not doing that and instead he's applied to every single position that this Aster guy applied to and I'm not too sure about the details but it means that the Aster guy will never get a job?

**valerie:** wait does that work?

**valerie:** don't job postings usually have multiple openings?

**April:** I just asked him about this and all he said was, "Connections"

**sara:** ykw i don't really get how it works but i'm not gonna get in the way between zahir and something he's laser focused on

**kai!:** good line of thinking there sara

**kai!**: it took me two months before i stopped getting in the way and becoming collateral damage

**kai!:** my credit score is still recovering

---

*April Evans, Valerie Torres*

**April:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**Valerie:** sara got you too i see!

**April:** You were right

**April:** I have never felt so taken care of

**April:** This must be what it's like to have older siblings

**Valerie:** i don't know how she does it with a straight face

**April:** The sincerity kills me

---

*April Evans, Valerie Torres*

**Valerie:** back

**April:** Glad to hear it!

**Valerie:** i'm sorry about today, i know we were supposed to hang out

**Valerie:** i'll talk to you tomorrow? maybe after your classes we can meet at monoceros again

**Valerie:** i'll buy you a drink

**April:** That works for me, I'll see you then

<br />

*April Evans, Kai Nakayama, Valerie Torres*

**Kai:** gonna give y'all some space!!

**Kai:** i'll be back to see nerry in hour but lmk if i should come back later

---

*Sara Al-Dosari, Valerie Torres*

**Valerie:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**Sara:** what's up?

**Valerie:** nothing sorry i needed to get that out of my system

**Valerie:** i should invest in a dedicated pillow to scream into at this rate

**Sara:** def would recommend

**Sara:** i have one and it's so useful

*nerry the narwhal fan club! (kai!, zahir, sara, April, valerie)*

**sara:** holy crap i need to rant about the newest kung fu panda

**sara:** i will never forgive dreamworks for their heinous crime

**sara:** they butchered my boy and sent him to a farm upstate "to retire happily for the rest of his life" my ass

**April:** The writing definitely took a nosedive with the fourth one yeah

**April:** The third one was already a cut below the first two

**kai!:** agree

**kai!:** kfp 2 was peak kfp imo

**valerie:** i liked the first one the best! simple happy vibes

**valerie:** 2 was kinda dark wasn't it?

**April:** Trauma!!! Definitely a big tone shift but Po went through SO much character development

**April:** It's also my favourite one

**sara:** no vallie's right it's supposed to be COMEDY

**sara:** i don't want stinky sad emotions in my comedy

**zahir:** what are you all talking about

**zahir:** the fourth one was far and away the best one because it had zhen in it

**zahir:** easily the best character in the franchise

**valerie:** oh boy

<br />

*Several people are typing...*

<br />

**sara:** i'm impressed

**sara:** somehow you managed to hit the 25% chance of picking the worst movie

**sara:** then having the worst possible opinion about that movie

**kai!:** i was not expecting to learn today that zahir was better at cooking than i am

**valerie:** but you guys live together

**zahir:** anyone can cook better than kai

**zahir:** it is a very low bar

**April:** Not gonna lie I didn't expect that

**April:** Zahir what can you make?

**zahir:** pasta

**April:** ...Kai what can you make?

**kai!:** pasta

**zahir:** no you can't

**zahir:** stop lying

**kai!:** no i can't :(

**kai!:** but zahir can also make curry

**sara:** you can't??

**kai!:** i don't know how to cook ;-;

**sara:** ok i thought that was like

**sara:** could not fry an egg or something

**sara:** i did not expect it to be could-not-boil-an-egg level

**kai!:** i can boil an egg!

**kai!:** but with curry you have to watch the water levels and make sure you don't add too many vegetables or else it becomes watery

**April:** Then you use starch to thicken it up

**valerie:** you can also add more curry paste if it's not strong enough!

**valerie:** that can happen when it's watery

**kai!:** all of you are culinary geniuses

**sara:** idk what to tell you man this is kinda on you

**sara:** even vallie knows and she can't even eat curry bc she dies to spicy food
