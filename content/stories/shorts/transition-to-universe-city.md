Dear Chancellor Wright,

Leeco's Board of Directors convened last night and have appointed me to share with you
their decision regarding the expansion of Universe City. Token resistance from the district
boards were swiftly overturned with immense support from the populace.

Universe City, the "second capital" of Leeco has grown tremendously in cultural and
economic value to the nation over the past several years. Effective 1 October 2022,
Universe City will be designated the official capital city of Leeco. District boards have
already been instructed to begin the process of migrating, and Administration are roughly
one-third of the way done the transition.
Because the decision was made unanimously, consider it impossible to revoke the will of
the Board. Cekendery must maintain good standing with the Board during the transitory
period.

I wish you the best of luck in maintaining unity.

Your Studious Pupil,\
Ira Hagey\
Vice Chancellor of Leeco\
