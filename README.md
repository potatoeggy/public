# Eggworld v3: Nuxt 3

After hand-written HTML and a static site generator comes Nuxt!

**WARN: Volar 0.40.0 breaks all type-checking and I don't know why â€” stick with Volar 0.39.5.**

Post-build instructions (while prerendering is bork)

 - Compile `/script.ts` to `/script.js` (`tsc script.ts -m esnext -t esnext --moduleReslution node`)
