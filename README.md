# Eggworld v3: Nuxt 3

After hand-written HTML and a static site generator comes Nuxt!

**WARN: Volar 0.40.0 breaks all type-checking and I don't know why — stick with Volar 0.39.5.**

**WARN: Nuxt 3 is too new that prerendering actually renders a ton of JS and causes blinking — remove all `Prose*.mjs` to stop it**

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.
