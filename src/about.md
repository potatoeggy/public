This site is generated by the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) with templates and Markdown — because really, writing HTML by hand is tedious and I don't know why I ever tried — and its source is available [here](https://git.eggworld.tk/eggy/public). The theme this site uses is taken from [here.](https://github.com/kohrongying/11ty-blog-starter)

The following services are publicly running on this server:

## [Plex](https://plex.eggworld.tk)

This was beyond stupid and took far too much time to get working behind nginx. I'm currently working to replace it with Jellyfin as it becomes more mature.

## [Gitea](https://git.eggworld.tk)

Gitea hosts the Eifueo project as well as a few other items that I deem not worthy to go on GitHub.

## [Eifueo](https://eifueo.eggworld.tk)

Generated by [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org), this site aims to collate my notes and I hope others might find it helpful.

## [Calibre](https://calibre.eggworld.tk)

As an avid reader of…"user-generated content", I store a database of stories here and sync them with my Kobo.

## Minecraft

The domain constantly changes and the server is whitelisted, so don't bother looking.
