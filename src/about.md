Hello! It's very nice to meet you — I'm a student and Linux enthusiast who is quite passionate about some subjects but is quite lazy in every other.

I've dabbled extensively and non-extensively in a variety of topics to play with, including:

 - competitive programming on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/eggy)
 - GUI toolkits very very briefly in GTK, Qt, and Swing
 - Linux and server administration
 - web "development" in the form of a Chrome extension and my sites
 - Godot Engine Cat Simulator DX
 - ski instruction
 - writing of literature
 - emulation
 - Discord bots

…and other things that I'm forgetting right now.
