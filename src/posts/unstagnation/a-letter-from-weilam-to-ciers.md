Mrs. Rio Nohigi\
Prime Minister\

Ciers

This letter is to inform you that Eos will not be able to hold this year's Continental Summit. The explosion detonated by Ptuyo has crippled large parts of the tribe, and I am deeply sorry to determine that this makes Eos unsafe for a gathering of world leaders. As per section 6 of the Saiyu Peace Agreement, responsibility for the organisation of the Summit will be transferred to Ciers.

This letter was sent on behalf of Eos by accelerated approval from the Ean High Representative of the Enigmatic Council.

Best regards,\
Brendan May\
Chairman of the Enigma Alliance\
