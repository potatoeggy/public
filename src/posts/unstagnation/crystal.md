“Jordan,” I groaned, slowly laying my head back down on my pillow, “now what did you have to do that for?” I reached for the edge of my blanket, trying to pull it over my head to escape the wrath of the evil sunbeams streaming through my window.

“Mom says it’s time to get up! She’s making pancakes!” The little rascal jumped up and down before bounding off my bed and out of my bedroom. 

I said sleepily, still not fully awake, “Pancakes…? What are pancakes?”

Then my brain finally finished booting up. My eyes widened, and I flung my blankets away to finish my morning routine as fast as possible as my nose registered a wonderful aroma floating from the kitchen downstairs. “Pancakes! Wait! Save some for me!”
